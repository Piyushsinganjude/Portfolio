         My experience includes me as working as an intern in the companies like taskiby,IST Infotech,Purefoodsdelhi,Oasis Infobyte where i have been working on the technologies like creating interactive user interfaces, implementing responsive designs, and optimizing the overall user experience,  I got the chance to work on the backend systems using technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. This involved designing RESTful APIs, handling authentication and authorization, and integrating with databases to store and retrieve data efficiently, I was actively involved in writing unit tests and performing integration testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. Debugging issues and fixing bugs were also important aspects of my internship experience,I worked with tools like Git and GitHub for version control and collaborated with other team members using agile development methodologies.
